# Paraphrase-Detection
A Hybrid RoBERTa-LSTM model which uses the strengths of both the BERT based RoBERTa model as well as the sequential LSTM model for the task of 
paraphrase identification on the Quora Question Pair Dataset.
Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset consists of over 400,000 question pairs, and each question pair is annotated with a binary value indicating whether the two questions are paraphrase of each other.
